Given a and b (with a > b), let
S := a + b
D := a - b

Note that:
(a^3 + b^3) = S (a^2 - ab + b^2)
D^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2
S^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2

So:
a^3 + b^3 = S (D^2 + 3 S^2)

So we factor a3b3 and for each possible S dividing it,
we see if an integer D results.


We also know that S < 4 (a^3 + b^3) ^ (1/3) which we could use
to limit the divisors we need to check. (proof of inequality from a > b?)
