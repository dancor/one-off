# Ideas
- Look at longest ==Portuguese== sections for best summary planning?
- Most entries are verb forms?
- Pull pt from English:Translations (a reverse lookup)
- Convert senseid's to "(the sense)"

# Old notes
kill: ====Quotations==== ====Derived terms==== ===Alternative forms===
kill for now: ===Pronunciation=== ===Etymology=== ====See also====
good ones: ===Proper noun===, Adjective Noun Verb etc
usually repeated in the tags after anyway?
- also look for pt translations in english word entries?
