# Try next:
- try intents to make danl-button work w/ screen off
- try to save my mods to github
- try to make a colemak app

# Current plan:
- Termux is deprecated on Android 6 and not receiving package updates, but it
  still can plays audio files in background. I can't get UserLAnd to.
- Use UserLAnd for everything else?

# Apps 12: Hom Cam Con Fdr Net Pho Tas Ta2 Ter Use Xse Set
- Removed: androidVNC bVNCFree Easer ExternalKeyboardHelper MultiVNC
  Pleco("corrupted"-every-install) VuzixNews Weather Yelp
- cannot remove: Camera Control Photos
- left: F-Droid Netflix Tasker Termux Userland XServerXSDL

# Try later:
- sshd on port 2022
- Copy current setup off.
- Graphical browser: On Userland chromium-browser segfaulted. Netsurf has
  no packages in Ubuntu 18.04 (but does in 17.10 and 18.10?).  Try building
  netsurf?
- Colemak for all of Android w/o proprietary app. Should fix CapsLock
  madness.
- Removed xterm border.

# Podcast battery stats:
- 5:08 84%
- 5:13 81%, 5:38 71% -> 25m/10% so expect 20% in 128m=2h8m at 7:49pm.
  5:51 68%
  6:00 56%  28%/52m  ~2m/% (60%=2h)
  7:07 43%
  7:28 38% plug in
  7:33 44% 4-lights (fast)
  7:57 80% 4-lights
- pause/play w/o keyboard? based on earbud button would be best..
- v2: also running on raspi0

# Working in Termux:
- play mp3 with mpv (note sox "play" shows playing stats but is silent)
  And note UserLAnd only plays audio thru XServerXSDL, but the audio shuts
  off if you turn off the screen or XServerXSDL is not the foreground app.

# Working in UserLAnd+Ubuntu+XServerXSDL:
- Play mp3 with sox "play" (note mpv permissions error even w/ sudo)
- Ran [~ sudo unminimize] to get manpages
- Installed tmux
- Fullscreened xterm w/ wmctrl.

# Next for UserLAnd Xorg:
- Alt+Tab alternative; use xv to see what keys are.
  - "Command/Windows" keys don't get to UserLAnd.
  - So most interesting keys (w/ keycode) are:
    Alt_L(64) Alt_R(108) Control_L(37) Shift_R(62) Shift_L(50) Delete(119)
    Left(113) Right(114) Up(111) Down(116) Backspace(22) []
    keycode 10 is # 1.
    keycode 11 is # 2.
    9Escape 67F1 .. 76F10 95F11 96F12 119Delete

- graphical browser ideally that can do duolingo
  try 
- Faster way to bootstrap my mods?

# Next for Vuzix Blade Android:
- what filesystems are supported for microsd card?

# Colemak in Android generally:
  - External Keyboard Helper Demo works but find FOSS or make
  - Look at: extra-keyboard-layouts finqwerty
# ssh to UserLAnd Ubuntu
  - May have to figure out what to do about systemd install failing
  - Is there something else to try besides openssh-server?
# Xorg:
  - kill Fluxbox permanent-bottom-bar
  - install wmctrl
  - remove xorg decorations

# If can get software end working well, then consider exotic hardware for
  keyboardless usage

# Note Raccoon downloads APKs from Google Play Store even "bundle" ones
# Termux:
  - 5ba3f7cf6d8b2c29eb4f4d51a6a8961db502500d last time supported Sdk 22.
    2019-10-07. This works as of 2020-10 but legacy pkg db, no more updates.
# main section: smartglasses v1 todo:
  - 1) keyboard over bluetooth
  - 2) my own android app receiving keystrokes
# testing w/ little old battery pack:
  - 5:22pm 53% and powerpack immediately jumped to 3 lights. bt on. wifi off.
    screen left on. brightness 10.
  - 5:26pm 60% powerpack still at 3 lights. set brightness to 1 now.
# later:
  - batteries from 2020-10:
    - 89c/Ah: $23.91/26.8Ah https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B08BRDVGP1
    - 115: $22.99/20Ah https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B07YPY31FL               
  - investigate wired data transfer
# work on soon: using smartglasses w/o clon:
  - look into battery pack in pocket
  - smartglasses are always at least the display. if android is too annoying
    may try raspi in pocket too. how does battery life compare?
  - mode w/ keyboard
  - mode w/o keyboard: what is input method here? wired/wireless clicker opts?
# if just make a C app https://github.com/cnlohr/rawdrawandroid
