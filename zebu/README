- Currently trying out UserLAnd & Ubuntu & XServerXSDL
- Colemak in Android generally:
  - External Keyboard Helper Demo works but find FOSS or make
  - Look at: extra-keyboard-layouts finqwerty
- ssh to UserLAnd Ubuntu
  - May have to figure out what to do about systemd install failing
  - Is there something else to try besides openssh-server?
- Xorg:
  - kill Fluxbox permanent-bottom-bar
  - install wmctrl
  - remove xorg decorations

- If can get software end working well, then consider exotic hardware for
  keyboardless usage

- Note Raccoon downloads APKs from Google Play Store even "bundle" ones
- Termux:
  - 5ba3f7cf6d8b2c29eb4f4d51a6a8961db502500d last time supported Sdk 22.
    2019-10-07. This works as of 2020-10 but legacy pkg db, no more updates.
- main section: smartglasses v1 todo:
  - 1) keyboard over bluetooth
  - 2) my own android app receiving keystrokes
- testing w/ little old battery pack:
  - 5:22pm 53% and powerpack immediately jumped to 3 lights. bt on. wifi off.
    screen left on. brightness 10.
  - 5:26pm 60% powerpack still at 3 lights. set brightness to 1 now.
- later:
  - batteries from 2020-10:
    - 89c/Ah: $23.91/26.8Ah https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B08BRDVGP1
    - 115: $22.99/20Ah https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B07YPY31FL               
  - investigate wired data transfer
- work on soon: using smartglasses w/o clon:
  - look into battery pack in pocket
  - smartglasses are always at least the display. if android is too annoying
    may try raspi in pocket too. how does battery life compare?
  - mode w/ keyboard
  - mode w/o keyboard: what is input method here? wired/wireless clicker opts?
- if just make a C app https://github.com/cnlohr/rawdrawandroid
