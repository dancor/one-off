  - Look into possible bug: The current codes for end, home, pageup and pagedown just each
    cause a tidle to appear in the terminal. Verify it works w/ keyboard or try in vim?

  - Speculative ideas: IPA symbols? korean? japanese?
- Termux possible plans:
  - Install openssh and try sshing to zebu port 8022.
  - Get things to run on device boot: https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Termux:Boot
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency
  - zebu touchpad https://www.vuzix.com/Developer/KnowledgeBase/Detail/65
    12 capturable (two finger hold not; 2 holds, 10 taps/swipes)
    2 swipes / second?  type 100 characters w/ 2 swipes each or make
    common letters one swipe for speed? is it consistent enough?
    - UP and DOWN sometimes triple-fire (no others!) but just have a timeout
      for those
  - Try Raspi0W w/ 64G-microsd
    - Record wire setup
    - cp zebu podcasts to clon (make space..)
    - Check what was on on 64G card
    - Write to 64G card incl. zebu audio
  - FluxmobBolt is 3Ah. If Zero W averages 0.2 A then 15h.
  - Termux-tts-speak w/ mkfifo (or inotify dir alt works?)
    https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Termux-tts-speak
    - Make mpv announce names
  - v ~/z/README colemak github-Termux-~/bin-scripts?/fork-dancomp-non-hs..
- start stat-comp?

# Pros to working w/ stat
- No-video mode possible and probably longer battery w/ it
- More control
- Possibly easier to carry around
# Cons
- Time to set up and maintain new system (but already have uSD)
- Dual-mode is more to carry and charge
  (possibly also continue zebu-mode, but syncing is issue then too, although
  prob want backup plan anyway)
- stat is a little awkward; just make thin cardboard case?
- dual-mode means writing transfer code
  (possibly long development time on zebu end and stat end)
- stat is less proven (could have worse Bluetooth or Wifi range?)

# Try next:
- try to make a Colemak app
- try to save Termux files to github
- try ssh to/from Termux: what's best way?

# Current plan:
- Termux is deprecated on Android 6 and not receiving package updates, but it
  still can plays audio files in background. I can't get UserLAnd to.
- Use UserLAnd for everything else?

# Apps 12: Hom Cam Con Fdr Net Pho Tas Ta2 Ter Use Xse Set
- Removed: androidVNC bVNCFree Easer ExternalKeyboardHelper MultiVNC
  Pleco("corrupted"-every-install) VuzixNews Weather Yelp
- cannot remove: Camera Control Photos
- left: F-Droid Netflix Tasker Termux Userland XServerXSDL

# Try later:
- sshd on port 2022
- Copy current setup off.
- Graphical browser: On Userland chromium-browser segfaulted. Netsurf has
  no packages in Ubuntu 18.04 (but does in 17.10 and 18.10?).  Try building
  netsurf?
- Colemak for all of Android w/o proprietary app. Should fix CapsLock
  madness.
- Removed xterm border.

# Battery stats:
- Overnight w/ bluetooth but doing nothing next morning 64%.
- 5:08 84%
- 5:13 81%, 5:38 71% -> 25m/10% so expect 20% in 128m=2h8m at 7:49pm.
  5:51 68%
  6:00 56%  28%/52m  ~2m/% (60%=2h)
  7:07 43%
  7:28 38% plug in
  7:33 44% 4-lights (fast)
  7:57 80% 4-lights
- pause/play w/o keyboard? based on earbud button would be best..
- v2: also running on raspi0

# Working:
- app2/ is an Android app that captures KeyEvent.KEYCODE_MEDIA_PLAY
  and KeyEvent.KEYCODE_MEDIA_PAUSE, so I can toggle mpv play/pause in Termux.
- Termux: play mp3 with mpv (note sox "play" shows playing stats but silent)
  And note UserLAnd only plays audio thru XServerXSDL, but the audio shuts
  off if you turn off the screen or XServerXSDL is not the foreground app.
- UserLAnd+Ubuntu+XServerXSDL:
  - Play mp3 with sox "play" (note mpv permissions error even w/ sudo) but only
    w/ XServerXSDL in foreground and screen on.
  - Ran [~ sudo unminimize] to get manpages
  - Installed tmux
  - Fullscreen Xterm w/ Wmctrl and Fluxbox settings.
- Microsd card working as Fat32.

## Old:
# Next for UserLAnd Xorg:
- Alt+Tab alternative; use xv to see what keys are.
  - "Command/Windows" keys don't get to UserLAnd.
  - So most interesting keys (w/ keycode) are:
    Alt_L(64) Alt_R(108) Control_L(37) Shift_R(62) Shift_L(50) Delete(119)
    Left(113) Right(114) Up(111) Down(116) Backspace(22) []
    keycode 10 is # 1.
    keycode 11 is # 2.
    9Escape 67F1 .. 76F10 95F11 96F12 119Delete

- graphical browser ideally that can do duolingo
- Faster way to bootstrap my mods?

# Colemak in Android generally:
  - External Keyboard Helper Demo works but find FOSS or make
  - Look at: extra-keyboard-layouts finqwerty

# If can get software end working well, then consider exotic hardware for
  keyboardless usage

# Note Raccoon downloads APKs from Google Play Store even "bundle" ones
# Termux:
  - 5ba3f7cf6d8b2c29eb4f4d51a6a8961db502500d last time supported Sdk 22.
    2019-10-07. This works as of 2020-10 but legacy pkg db, no more updates.
# main section: smartglasses v1 todo:
  - 1) keyboard over bluetooth
  - 2) my own android app receiving keystrokes
# testing w/ little old battery pack:
  - 5:22pm 53% and powerpack immediately jumped to 3 lights. bt on. wifi off.
    screen left on. brightness 10.
  - 5:26pm 60% powerpack still at 3 lights. set brightness to 1 now.
# later:
  - batteries from 2020-10:
    - 89c/Ah: $23.91/26.8Ah https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B08BRDVGP1
    - 115: $22.99/20Ah https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B07YPY31FL               
  - investigate wired data transfer
# work on soon: using smartglasses w/o clon:
  - look into battery pack in pocket
  - smartglasses are always at least the display. if android is too annoying
    may try raspi in pocket too. how does battery life compare?
  - mode w/ keyboard
  - mode w/o keyboard: what is input method here? wired/wireless clicker opts?
# if just make a C app https://github.com/cnlohr/rawdrawandroid
