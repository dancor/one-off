# To pull info on RTP on-demand videos (series and standalone films):
- In browser go to https://rtp.pt/
- Clicking "RTPPlay" gets https://www.rtp.pt/play/
- Clicking "Programas" gets https://www.rtp.pt/play/programas
- Change just-under-top-right dropdown from "Todos os Canais" to
  "Todos os Canais de Televisão". This puts you at:
  https://www.rtp.pt/play/programas/tema/channels-tv
  (so you could just start there).
- Over and over press End key and wait for more to load.
  This will take a long time and eventually create CPU load.
  It's probably worth automating the periodic End key sending like
  (forever sh -c 'sleep 1 && xdotool key End') then focus the browser.
  It should take about 20 minutes? Then focus terminal and ^C xdotool.
- Save the source of the browser page. You don't need the _files directory
  with it unless you want to use the thumbnails to select shows locally.
- This source has a link for every RTP on-demand series. Each season has its
  own link. But they won't necessarily all be available to you where you are.
- Use a Greasemoney script so when a video link is loaded it checks if
  the video is loading or saying it's not available in your region (this is a
  good time to see what has subtitles too), and sends this info to a local web
  service (that you have to make), that saves it to disk. Load the link for
  each series and close it after the Greasemonkey script runs. Now you know
  what series are available and what series are subtitled. Whew.
- Note that some of the "videos" just have a still image the whole
  time, like the kids meditions series "Inspira, Expira".
  I'm still calling those videos. RTP's "podcasts" are mp3-format audio series
  with no video whatsoever.)
